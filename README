Programs to conduct and research algorithmic composition.

generate_four_chord_turnaround.py - Creates a series of four-bar (each repeated) sequences of chord changes (roots only), one chord per bar where a chord may be repeated. A silent measure separates each sequence. The intent is to listen to each sequence and score them on whether I like them (for different applications:  verse, chorus, bridge, introduction). These scores will then be used to train machine learning models.
